                <p>While my professional life revolves around building scalable, high-performance software, I’ve also spent many years building something equally important: community.</p>
                <p>I'm an active member and past leader in several Masonic organizations across Ohio. These roles have helped shape my leadership style — grounded in service, tradition, mentorship, and integrity. From organizing events to guiding members through degrees and ceremonies, I've gained valuable experience in team coordination, long-term planning, and community engagement.</p>
                <p>These experiences go far beyond titles — they reflect a commitment to stewardship, trust, and showing up when it matters.</p>
